Alright — this is actually a \*\*very strong, real-world problem statement\*\*. If you execute this properly, this can go beyond a hackathon project into a \*\*startup-level product\*\*.



I’ll break this down \*\*ruthlessly and clearly\*\* so you know exactly:



1\. What the PS actually means

2\. What you should build (real architecture)

3\. Tech stack (practical, not generic)

4\. Step-by-step execution plan

5\. How to stand out (this is key)



\---



\# 🔍 1. Understanding the Problem (No BS Version)



The core problem is:



👉 Patients are only checked every 3 months

👉 But diseases change DAILY

👉 Doctors have \*\*zero continuous data\*\*



So the hackathon wants:



> A system that uses \*\*voice as a health signal\*\*



\---



\## 💡 What is the actual idea?



Voice = hidden health data



From a \*\*15 sec recording\*\*, AI can detect:



\* Tremors → Parkinson’s

\* Breathlessness → Asthma / heart issues

\* Slurred speech → Stroke / neurological

\* Tone \& pitch → Depression

\* Speech rate → cognitive decline



👉 This is called \*\*Vocal Biomarkers\*\* 



\---



\## 🧠 Translation in simple terms



You're NOT building a voice recorder.



You're building:



> ⚠️ A daily health monitoring system using voice signals



\---

```



\---



\### 4. Silence Removal (optional but powerful)



```python

intervals = librosa.effects.split(y\_norm, top\_db=20)

```



\---



\## 🚨 Why this matters



Bad audio = garbage features = useless ML



\---



\# 🟠 4. FEATURE EXTRACTION (CORE AI PART)



\## 🎯 Purpose



Convert audio → numbers



\---



\## 🔧 Features You MUST Extract



\---



\## 🔹 1. MFCC (MOST IMPORTANT)



```python

mfcc = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr, n\_mfcc=13)

```



\### Parameters:



\* `n\_mfcc=13` → standard

\* Output: shape (13, time\_frames)



👉 Take mean:



```python

mfcc\_mean = mfcc.mean(axis=1)

```



\---



\## 🔹 2. Pitch (F0)



```python

pitch = librosa.yin(y, fmin=50, fmax=300)

pitch\_mean = pitch.mean()

```



\---



\## 🔹 3. Energy (Loudness)

energy\_mean = energy.mean()

```



\---



\## 🔹 4. Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR)



```python

zcr = librosa.feature.zero\_crossing\_rate(y)

zcr\_mean = zcr.mean()

```



\---



\## 🔹 5. Spectral Centroid (Voice brightness)



```python

centroid = librosa.feature.spectral\_centroid(y=y, sr=sr)

centroid\_mean = centroid.mean()

```



\---



\## 🔹 6. Speech Rate (Approx)



```python

tempo, \_ = librosa.beat.beat\_track(y=y, sr=sr)

```



\---



\## 📦 Final Feature Vector



```python

features = \[

&#x20; mfcc\_mean (13 values),

&#x20; pitch\_mean,

&#x20; energy\_mean,

&#x20; zcr\_mean,

&#x20; centroid\_mean,

# AI models





Good — this is the \*\*most practical question\*\* you’ve asked so far.



You want:



> ✅ Free

> ✅ Runs on your laptop

> ✅ Works for your voice biomarker project



Let me give you \*\*only realistic models\*\* (not hype).



\---



\# 🧠 FIRST — Reality Check



Your problem is \*\*NOT speech-to-text\*\*.



You need:



👉 \*\*audio → features → health insight\*\*



So don’t use heavy models like:



\* ❌ GPT

\* ❌ Large transformers

\* ❌ cloud APIs (not allowed)



\---



\# 🟢 BEST MODELS YOU CAN RUN ON LAPTOP



I’ll rank them \*\*based on practicality for YOUR project\*\*



\---



\# 🥇 1. LIBROSA + SCIKIT-LEARN MODEL (BEST FOR YOU)



\## 🔥 This is your winning stack



\* Librosa → feature extraction

\* Scikit-learn → ML model



\---



\## 💡 Why this is PERFECT



\* Runs on \*\*any laptop (even 8GB RAM)\*\*

\* No GPU needed

\* Super fast (<1 sec inference)

\* Fully offline



\---



\## 🧠 Model Options



\### ✔ RandomForest (BEST)



```python

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

```



\### ✔ MLP (slightly advanced)



```python

from sklearn.neural\_network import MLPClassifier

```



\---



\## 📊 Real Example



There are already working systems using:



\* MFCC

\* Chroma

\* Mel features

\* MLP classifier (\[GitHub]\[1])



\---



\## 🧠 Verdict



👉 \*\*Use this. No debate.\*\*



\---



\# 🥈 2. SPEECH EMOTION RECOGNITION (SER) MODELS



\## Example:



\* RAVDESS-based models

\* MLP / CNN



\---



\## 💡 What they do



\* Detect emotion from voice

\* Use:



&#x20; \* MFCC

&#x20; \* Pitch

&#x20; \* Energy



\---



\## 🧠 Why useful for YOU



👉 Emotion = mental health signal

👉 Can map to:



\* Depression

\* Stress



\---



\## Example pipeline (already built):



\* Librosa + MLP classifier (\[GitHub]\[2])



\---



\## ⚠️ Limitation



\* Not medical

\* But \*\*great for demo\*\*



\---



\# 🥉 3. ISOLATION FOREST (SMART HACK)



\## 🔥 This is underrated



```python

from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

```



\---



\## 💡 What it does



\* Detects anomalies (NOT classification)



\---



\## 🧠 Why this is GENIUS for hackathon



👉 You don’t need labeled medical data



Instead:



```text

Normal voice → baseline

Change in voice → anomaly

```



\---



\## Example Output



```json

{

&#x20; "status": "anomaly",

&#x20; "score": 42,

&#x20; "message": "Voice pattern changed significantly"

}

```



\---



\## 🧠 Verdict



👉 Combine with RandomForest = 🔥🔥



\---



\# 🟡 4. WHISPER (OPTIONAL, NOT PRIMARY)



\## Whisper



\---



\## 💡 What it does



\* Speech → text



\---



\## Why NOT main model?



\* Doesn’t detect health

\* Only transcription (\[Wikipedia]\[3])



\---



\## When to use



👉 Extra feature:



\* Analyze speech content

\* Detect:



&#x20; \* Slurring

&#x20; \* word gaps



\---



\---



\# 🔵 5. SPEECHBRAIN (ADVANCED OPTION)

\# 🏗️ 2. CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES



\### ✅ Why PostgreSQL (Supabase)?



\* Strong relationships (users ↔ logs)

\* JSONB for ML features

\* Powerful queries for analytics

\* ACID compliance (important for healthcare)



\---



\### ✅ Key Strategy



| Data Type   | Storage          |

| ----------- | ---------------- |

| User info   | Table            |

| Voice logs  | Table            |

| Features    | JSONB            |

| Audio files | Supabase Storage |

| Alerts      | Table            |

\# 🧩 3. DATABASE SCHEMA (MAIN TABLES)



\---



\# 🟢 1. USERS TABLE



\## 🎯 Purpose



Store user identity



\---



\## Schema



```sql

CREATE TABLE users (

&#x20;   id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen\_random\_uuid(),

&#x20;   name TEXT,

&#x20;   email TEXT UNIQUE,

&#x20;   age INT,

&#x20;   gender TEXT,

&#x20;   created\_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()

);

```



\---



\## 🧠 Notes



\* Use Supabase Auth → auto user management

\* You can extend with profile fields



\---



\---



\# 🔵 2. VOICE\_LOGS TABLE (CORE TABLE)



\## 🎯 Purpose



Store every daily recording + AI result



\---



\## Schema



```sql

CREATE TABLE voice\_logs (

&#x20;   id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen\_random\_uuid(),

&#x20;   user\_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

&#x20;   

&#x20;   audio\_url TEXT, -- Supabase storage link

&#x20;   

&#x20;   duration INT, -- seconds

&#x20;   sample\_rate INT,

&#x20;   

&#x20;   features JSONB, -- MFCC, pitch, energy

&#x20;   

&#x20;   score FLOAT, -- 0–100

&#x20;   risk\_level TEXT, -- low / medium / high

&#x20;   prediction TEXT, -- respiratory / neurological

&#x20;   

&#x20;   confidence FLOAT,

&#x20;   

&#x20;   created\_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()

);

```



\---



\## 🧠 Why JSONB for features?



Because features look like:



```json

{

&#x20; "mfcc": \[....],

&#x20; "pitch\_mean": 120,

&#x20; "energy": 0.03

}

```



👉 Flexible + fast querying



\---



\---



\# 🟡 3. ALERTS TABLE



\## 🎯 Purpose



Store anomalies / warnings



\---



\## Schema



```sql

CREATE TABLE alerts (

&#x20;   id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen\_random\_uuid(),

&#x20;   user\_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

&#x20;   

&#x20;   voice\_log\_id UUID REFERENCES voice\_logs(id),

&#x20;   

&#x20;   message TEXT,

&#x20;   severity TEXT, -- low / medium / high

&#x20;   

&#x20;   created\_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()

);

```



\---



\## 🧠 Example



```json

{

&#x20; "message": "Breathing instability detected",

&#x20; "severity": "high"

}

```



\---



\---



\# 🟠 4. DAILY\_SUMMARY TABLE (IMPORTANT FOR PERFORMANCE)



\## 🎯 Purpose



Pre-compute trends (avoid heavy queries)



\---



\## Schema



```sql

CREATE TABLE daily\_summary (

&#x20;   id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen\_random\_uuid(),

&#x20;   user\_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),

&#x20;   

&#x20;   date DATE,

&#x20;   

&#x20;   avg\_score FLOAT,

&#x20;   risk\_level TEXT,

&#x20;   

&#x20;   created\_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),

&#x20;   

&#x20;   UNIQUE(user\_id, date)

);

```



\---



\## 🧠 Why this matters



👉 Instead of calculating trends every time

👉 You store precomputed values → FAST dashboard



\---



\---



\# 🟣 5. MODEL\_METADATA TABLE (ADVANCED)



\## 🎯 Purpose



Track model versions



\---



```sql

CREATE TABLE model\_metadata (

&#x20;   id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen\_random\_uuid(),

&#x20;   

&#x20;   model\_version TEXT,

&#x20;   accuracy FLOAT,

&#x20;   

&#x20;   created\_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()

);

```



\---



\---



\# 📦 4. STORAGE ARCHITECTURE (AUDIO FILES)



\---



\## Supabase Storage Bucket



\### Bucket Name:



```text

voice-recordings

```



\---



\## File Structure



```text

voice-recordings/

&#x20;  user\_id/

&#x20;      2026-04-11.wav

&#x20;      2026-04-12.wav

```



\---



\## Store in DB:



```text

audio\_url → public URL

```



\---



\---



\# 🔗 5. RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM



```text

users

&#x20; ↓

voice\_logs

&#x20; ↓

alerts



users

&#x20; ↓

daily\_summary

```



\---



\---



\# ⚡ 6. INDEXING (VERY IMPORTANT)



\---



\## Add indexes



```sql

CREATE INDEX idx\_user\_logs ON voice\_logs(user\_id);

CREATE INDEX idx\_created\_at ON voice\_logs(created\_at);

CREATE INDEX idx\_alert\_user ON alerts(user\_id);

```



\---



\## Why?



👉 Faster queries for:



\* Dashboard

\* Trends

\* Alerts



\---



\---



\# 🧠 7. QUERY PATTERNS (REAL USE)



\---



\## 📊 Get last 7 days data



```sql

SELECT \* FROM voice\_logs

WHERE user\_id = '123'

ORDER BY created\_at DESC

LIMIT 7;

```



\---



\## 📈 Get trend



```sql

SELECT date, avg\_score

FROM daily\_summary

WHERE user\_id = '123';

```



\---



\## 🚨 Get alerts



```sql

SELECT \* FROM alerts

WHERE user\_id = '123'

ORDER BY created\_at DESC;

```



\---



\---



\# 🔐 8. SECURITY (SUPABASE RLS)



\---



\## Enable Row Level Security



```sql

ALTER TABLE voice\_logs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

```



\---



\## Policy Example



```sql

CREATE POLICY "Users can access their data"

ON voice\_logs

FOR SELECT

USING (auth.uid() = user\_id);

```



\---



\---



\# 🚀 9. DATA FLOW (WITH DB)



```text

User records audio

&#x20;  ↓

Upload to Supabase Storage

&#x20;  ↓

Backend processes audio

&#x20;  ↓

Features + ML result generated

&#x20;  ↓

Insert into voice\_logs

&#x20;  ↓

Update daily\_summary

&#x20;  ↓

Generate alerts (if needed)

```



\---



\---



\# 💥 FINAL ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY



You now have:



```text

PostgreSQL (Supabase)

&#x20;  ├── users

&#x20;  ├── voice\_logs

&#x20;  ├── alerts

&#x20;  ├── daily\_summary

&#x20;  ├── model\_metadata

&#x20;  └── storage (audio files)

```
